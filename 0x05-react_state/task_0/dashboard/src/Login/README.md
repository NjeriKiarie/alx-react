Tips:

To simulate an input change, you can use the simulate method and use the change event
Requirements:

The state should have all the default values set in the constructor
Do not forget to bind the functions you are passing to the children to improve performances
When submitting the form, the page should not reload
Make sure that the button is always enabled when the two inputs are not empty. And make sure that the button is always disabled when one of the inputâ€™s value is empty
When running, there should not be any lint error in the console
